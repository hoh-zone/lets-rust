I'm nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Then there's a pair of us - don't tell!
They'd banish us, you know.

How dreary to be somebody!
How public, like a frog
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!

-- Emily Dickinson

Rust is a systems programming language
that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults,
and guarantees thread safety.

Rust empowers everyone
to build reliable and efficient software.

The Rust programming language helps you write faster, more reliable software.
High-level ergonomics and low-level control are often at odds in programming language design;
Rust challenges that tradeoff.

Through balancing powerful technical capacity and a great developer experience,
Rust gives you the option to control low-level details (such as memory usage)
without all the hassle traditionally associated with such control.

🦀 Rust 是一门系统编程语言
专注于安全、速度和并发。

Rust 的设计让你能够编写快速且安全的代码，
同时避免了传统系统编程语言中的常见陷阱。

无论你是经验丰富的系统程序员，
还是刚刚开始学习编程，
Rust 都能为你提供强大的工具和友好的社区支持。

Welcome to the Rust community!
Happy coding with Rust! 🚀
